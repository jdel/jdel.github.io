About Me
========

I am Julien Del-Piccolo, 28 year old IT professional operating in the fund industry in Luxembourg. I am mostly spending my day working with very closed systems.

I am however a big open source enthusiast and have been a Debian user for years. I am not a coder, but you will find some of my scripts published on [GitHub](https://github.com/jdel/). If you are looking for some old script that you cannot find there, then it has most likely been dumped.

I have also been working my way around the Synology products and OS for a few years now and you will find here some [packaging I have done](packages.html).

I spent the last ten years teaching myself music too. I currently play the bass and the cajon in two bands. You can find more details on the [music page](music.html).

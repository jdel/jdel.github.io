Music Projects
==============

I have been playing the bass for about ten years now and I am still performing with the first band I joined: [Odokom](http://www.odokom.com).

[Odokom](http://www.odokom.com/) is a three-piece instrumental band that plays the kind of music that doesn't belong to a specific genre. It smells like 90's rock mixed with some funky rhythms.

In addition to the bass, I have recently taken on the cajon as it is as close I will get to having a full acoustic drum kit in a apartment.

[The AyeTunes](http://ayetun.es) is an acoustic trio --in which I pretend to be a drummer--, performing exclusively cover songs. All sorts of cover songs, from the 80's hit Eye Of The Tiger to the Franz Ferdinand's Take Me Out.

Should you fancy booking one of these bands for your birthday, your cousin's wedding or your aunt's funeral, don't hesitate to [mail me](mailto:julien@del-piccolo.com) directly.

Music Projects
==============

I have been playing the bass for about ten years now and I am currently performing with Atomic Rocket Seeders.

ARS is a four-piece band which plays the kind of music that doesn't belong to a specific genre. Formed by musicians with different music backgrounds, ARS creates a mix of 90s rock and more recent metal.

In addition to the bass, I have recently taken on the cajon as it is as close I will get to having a full acoustic drum kit in a apartment.

[The AyeTunes](http://ayetun.es) is an acoustic trio --in which I pretend to be a drummer--, performing exclusively cover songs. All sorts of cover songs, from the 80's hit Eye Of The Tiger to the Franz Ferdinand's Take Me Out.

Should you fancy booking [The AyeTunes](http://ayetun.es) for a birthday, a business event, or even a wedding, don't hesitate to [mail me](mailto:julien@del-piccolo.com) directly.
